"""TTL cache + single-flight dedupe for outbound calls (game-server
status polls, external lookups, etc).

Two jobs:

1. **Cache** successful results for a short TTL so a rapid sequence of
   actions from one user doesn't repeat the same request needlessly.
2. **Single-flight** concurrent requests for the same key — if two
   callers ask for the same key at once (e.g. two guilds polling the
   same server), exactly one outbound request happens; both callers
   receive the same result (or the same exception).

Failures are *not* cached — a transient failure shouldn't force a
caller to wait out a TTL before retrying. The single-flight dedupe
still protects against burst storms during outages.

Bot runs as one process per host, so in-process state is enough; no
redis.
