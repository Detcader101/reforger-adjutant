"""Shared discord.ui.View base with graceful error handling.

Discord persistent views don't route exceptions through the cog-level
app_command_error handler — the default on_error just logs to the
`discord.ui.view` logger, and the user sees the interaction silently
fail (or Discord's generic 'This interaction failed' toast). That's
miserable when the cause is a transient 5xx from Discord's own upstream.

ErrorHandledView catches any exception raised inside a button/select
callback, logs it with context, and sends an ephemeral message back to
the user with a friendlier description of the failure mode, voiced per
adjutant/voice.py. Every view in the bot inherits from this instead of
discord.ui.View directly.
